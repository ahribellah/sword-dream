READ-ME FILE FOR SECRET OF GREYWOOD

This scenario is designed to use Apple Chancery, an elegant font which is distributed as part of System 7.5. If you don't own System 7.5, the text window might look ugly.

Apple Chancery is usually installed as part of QuickDraw GX. You don't need to actually use the QuickDraw GX part of System 7.5 to play Secret of Graywood â€” simply check that you have the font installed.
