Sword Dream 3D

Heroes of the Black Tower
by Eugenio Spagnolini with Alex G. Raccuglia

Release notes

This scenario is meant to be played as your first adventure in the Sword Dream game system.

Heroes of the Black Tower pushes the graphical 3D engine inside Sword Dream 3D to its limits. Before you start playing, you must give Dream more memory â€” in order to load all of the graphics. 6000 KB is fine, 8000 KB is just great.
Click on the icon for Sword Dream 3D, the application. Select "Get info" in the File menu. In the window which appears, type 6000 (or 8000, if you can afford that) in both the "Minimum size" and the "Preferred size" boxes.

The picture of the Borderlands, at the beginning, is huge. On a slow computer the scenario might even take a couple of minutes to open.
