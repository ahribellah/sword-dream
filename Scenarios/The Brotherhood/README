Sword Dream 3D

The Brotherhood
by Luca Accomazzi

Release notes

DO NOT bring your best group into "The Brotherhood". Characters can't exit from that scenario - your group would be blocked inside.
"Brotherhood" is meant to be played by a lone rogue character, eigth level of experience, and you should create it from inside the scenario.

Players using the unregistered version of Sword Dream, please take note: since you're only allowed to create and use first level characters, this adventure will be much harder for you. You'll need quite a bit of luck, in addition to the brightness required of all players...
The suggestion, of course, is to register your copy of the game.

If you had disabled the background music in Dream, because the old songs tired you, do turn it back on. "Brotherhood" features a new soundtrack.
