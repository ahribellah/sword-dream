It is suggested that	the PICT is a four-bit, grey scale image.<LI>'Info' ID 1000: Information about the scenario from the scenario designer to	the Dream game system.  Warning: In order to keep Dream and its Conflict Resolver	working properly together this info is necessary. The Dream application will	assume standard values for the parameters if none exist but leave these fields	empty at your own risk.<LI>'ICN#': black and white icons for locations, monsters and objects. Resource	rules</ul><P>Under the MacOS<small><small>TM</small></small>, resources must have ID between 128 and 32767. Dream furthernarrows this numeric range. Resources in a scenario must have ID between 1000 and9999. All other valid IDs are reserved for usage by the Dream engine itself.<P>All resources should be kept purgeable (this isn't strictly necessary - that is,the game won't bomb - with current versions of the Dream application, but gamedesigners should comply if they wish to stay compatible with versions beyond1.x).<A NAME="check"><H2>Checking a scenario</H2></A><P>The best new feature for ScenarioMaker 1.5 is the availability of a "Checkscenario" feature. Use it often, use it well: ScenarioMaker will take a long lookat your work and tell you what's still missing to make a finished product. It'sthe next best thing to shipping a copy of the scenario to the Dream designers(yes, you can do that, we'll be glad to help, but ScenarioMaker can do this everytime you ask and be finished in a few seconds).<P>The inspection is very thorough: there isn't much that can escape ScenarioMaker'sattention.<P><b>Warning:</b> Checking only works when the scenario is open, but when there'sneither a place or arena, shown in the main (construction) window. Close all windowsbefore you check your scenario.<P>When ScenarioMaker is finished checking (it might take a few minutes: the morecomplex your scenario, the longer the search), it will report its findings in adialog box.<P>The box has a list of any found problems. If you click on an item, an explanationappears. Problems are divided in two categories: &quot;warnings&quot; and &quot;errors&quot;. Awarning might be ignored: it may be that you known perfectly well what you aredoing; ScenarioMaker is only reporting that something strange, or potentiallydangerous, is inside your scenario.<P>For example, ScenarioMaker might report:<P><i>WARNING:</i> You created a Place, but there is no reference to it in any otherplace, so the player characters won't ever be able to reach it.<P>There is normally no reason to have an unreachable place inside a scenario.Still, maybe you aren't finished creating your scenario, and are planning to addthe references to that place later on.<P>So, in general, a warning means that you'd better double check your scenario andensure that you are aware of what you are doing.<P>Errors, on the other hand, are problems that will make your scenario break insideSword Dream. For example:<P><i>ERROR:</i> There is no Place with an ID of 1000. Such a place is strictly required,since the game play must start from there.<P>In this case, ScenarioMaker is reporting a problem that you must fix or yourscenario won't work.<A NAME="rest"><H2>The rest of the rules</H2></A><P>Keep in mind that the Dream application is distributed has been available formore than a year now in its first version, v1.0.2. Dream 1.0 was included in atleast four CDs (two shareware collections in the US, one in France, and oneelectronic magazine). Thus, it is very widespread.<P>If you wish to create a scenario compatible with the old version 1.0, avoid usingthose Dream features which are marked "version 1.1 (1.2, 1.3... 1.6) orfollowing". If you do, Dream 1.0 will be able to play the scenario.<P>If you forfeit compatibility with the old version 1.0, you gain use of a slew ofnew feature and can use everything detailed in this manual (don't mind thereferences to versions between 1.1 and 1.4: those were never made availableoutside a small group of friends and beta testers in Italy).<P>There isn't much more to be said. To create your game scenario, you must simplycreate a new scenario file (the ScenarioMaker application will gladly do this foryou, or you may use ResEdit), and fill it with resources.<P>In the following chapters we will see much of the internal structure of Dream andthe concepts on which it is based. This knowledge will form the basis on whichyou'll build your scenarios.<P>Next, we'll follow a tutorial, so that you'll be able to build a simple scenarioand get the flavor of a ScenarioMaker session.<P>A small scenario, "Akko's place", is available on <A HREF="contact.html">request to Designers</A>: There youcan create characters of every class, have them easily reach any experiencelevel, and buy them powerful magic items. Thus, you can create characters forgame testing. To receive a copy, contact the Dream Team.<P>The rest of this manual is a reference guide; it's mostly devoted to the singleresource types: a paragraph for each, describing what it is used for and how tocreate one. In its last part, this manual will give away a few tips and tricks,suggestions and other miscellaneous information.<hr><P><small><A HREF="index.html">Return to Table of Contents</A></small><P><small><b>&copy;1998 Luca Accomazzi<BR>HTML code &copy;1998 James Dessart</b></small></BODY></HTML>
