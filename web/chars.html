Dream supports the following attacks (note: only a few of theseare available to a player character):<P>Code Kind of attack11 Illness, disease12 Curse13 Special $14 Death Magic15 Missile weapon (arrows, darts...)16 Magic weapon, +5 to hit17 Magic weapon, +4 to hit18 Magic weapon, +3 to hit19 Magic weapon, +2 to hit20 Magic weapon, +1 to hit21 Weapon (sword, mace, axe...)22 Energy (magic missiles, energy burst...)23 Experience level drain24 Turn to stone $25 Acid26 Poison27 Healing magic (cure graze or better)28 Electricity (shocking grasp, Galvani's spark...)29 Frost (Ice storm...)30 Fire (Fireball, dragon breath weapon...)31 Mind attack, psionics<P>$ Turn to stone is only available from version 1.5.<P>All attacks which can't be classified to one of the above are said to be"special" attacks. For example, the Slow spell, which slows monsters, constitutesa special attack.<P>A creature can be protected, either by its nature or through magic, from any ofthe attack forms. Protection can be either total (for example, you shouldn't beable to affect a skeleton with death magic, nor a giant worm with a mind attack)or partial (for example, a character protected via Protection from fire spell canstill be affected by fires, but takes only a half damage).DamageWhenever it is necessary to inflict damage on someone, either character ormonster, Dream must be told how heavy the attack form is. Typical damage rangesare:1 to 4 hit points for a knife 1 to 8 points for a long sword 1 to 12 points for ahalberd 5 to 30 points for a fireball created by a fifth level wizard 20-200points for an Armageddon spell created by a twentieth-level clericAs you can see, damage is given as a range of values: there's a minimum and amaximum. To assess a damage in the 1-6 range, Dream will generate a random numberthrowing a software six-sided die; you can instruct Dream to do so writing downinside the appropriate template that a weapon (or a spell) does damage with one(1) throw of a six (6) sided software die.By the way, even if there are no physical seven-sided dice in existence, Dreamcan simulate one.To generate a damage ranging from 2 to 12, you can instruct Dream to throw twodice with six sides. Dream will then sum the results. You might know that, bythrowing a couple of six-sided dice, results in the range 6 to 8 are the mostlikely: keep this in mind when designing damage ranges. For example, with the5-30 range quoted before (that is, five six-sided dice) it is very likely thatthe actual damage will be between 14 and 21; other values are much rarer.SpellsSpells fall into one of two broad categories: a few are instantaneous (take placeimmediately and have permanent effect, like Cure Graze, Curse Undead or BlastFireball), others have a variable duration and their effects vanish when the timeis over (like Protection from Fire or Feign Death).Material componentsAs you know, most spells require a material component to be cast. The followingcodes are used to specify the material components.Code Material 0 No material component required 128 Holy water 129 Amber 130 Batguano 132 Glass lens 133 Magnet 134 Mushroom 135 Quicksilver 136 Silver mirror200 Rations 201 Cure potion Any other The item whose resource id is equal to thecode. Use only items defined in your scenarios or listed in the "Dream Database"chapter. Note that any object can work as a spell component. This createsexciting possibilities: think of a scenario where the players know that only avery special, very secret spell can save the world. They have to locate thescroll where the spell is written, then they must locate a wondrous item which isrequired to cast the spell (what about an edelweiss, lost somewhere among hugemountains?)Spell level and IDsBoth wizard and cleric spells are given a level. The higher the level, the morepowerful the spell is. There is no relation between a spell resource ID and itslevel in Dream 1.5 and following.RangeAn attack (by spell or otherwise) is also given a range. If the attack can onlybe launched on somebody close to the attacker (like the thrust of a stiletto),then the range is said to be 1. This means that the square the defender is on canbe at most one unit distance from the attacker's one.All melee attacks have a range of one.An action which is only attempted by a creature on itself, like the Feign Deathspell, is said to have a range of zero.Attacks from afar, like an arrow from a bow, a dart, or a Magic Missile spell,obviously have a range greater than one.Area of effectAnother important characteristic of a spell is the area of effect. The followingpossibilities are supported by all versions of the Dream engine:Code Area of effect Example 0 The spellcaster Light 1 Any one member of thespellcaster's group Cure graze 2 Any one enemy A sword stroke 3 All members ofthe spellcaster group Cure all wounds 4 All enemies Curse all undead 5 Circulararea Fireball 6 Square area Ice storm 7 Straight path Call Lightning SavingthrowsA few spells always work their magic: Light, for example, invariably results in amagic form of illumination to appear above the caster's head. Some other spellsmight not work at times: such is the case for Slow. These spells are said to havea "saving throw" (the term is taken from traditional role playing games, wherethe working of the spell is adjudicated via the throw of a die. If the roll isgood, the creature which is target to the spell was "saved" from the spelleffects). The saving throws negates the effects of the spell (if the target is amonster, by the way, the higher the number of hit dice, the more likely it is themonster will be saved).Yet other spells can be "partially saved" against. Take "Blast Fireball", forexample: at best, the target might take only a half as much damage as prescribed(this excludes magical defences like "Protection from fire", of course). Thesespells are said to have a "save for one half" saving throw.Other spell attributesA spell may constitute a kind of attack (a fireball most certainly could beconsidered an attack by the unfortunate goblin caught in the middle). So, everyspell is attributed a code from the table in Inside Dream/Fighting/Attack forms.It is known as the spell "kind code".Spells ought to have an associated icon. If you browse through the spells insidethe Dream application, version 1.5, you'll notice that there's no icon for them.Icons will be shown in future releases for the game, though, so you should createone if you wish to stay compatible.Spell code selectorsDream needs a way to distinguish between variations of the same magic. Forexample, "Slow Poison", "Cure Poison" and "Poison" spells all represent differentforms of the same magic, and are distinguished via a special spell code.Listed below are the supported codes. Unless otherwise noted, all versions of thedream application support all codes for all spells-2:	"Rune"- protection from some attack form. This spell blocks the firstenemy spell of the specified kind, then automatically expires. Code -2 can't beused with petrify, poison and similar attack forms, whose effect is not physicaldamage. Code -2 is only supported by version 1.5 and greater.-1:	Protection from that attack form. Reduces all damage to one half, roundeddown, for the duration of the spell.0:	Attack of the spell type, which does damage as specified. For example, ifthe spell kind code is 30 (fire) and the code selector is 0 (attack) then you arecreating a fire-based attack spell, like Fireball.For Illness, poison, turn to stone:1:	Slow down effects of the attack form 2:	Cure effects of the attack form3:	Afflict target with the attack formFor special magic1:	Light 2:	Identify 3:	Slow 4:	Haste 5:	Feign death 7:	Restorelost experience levels 8:	Resurrect 9:	Dispel magic 10:	FlyThe following forms of special magic are only supported by Dream version 1.5 orgreater:11:	Soul search (detect alignment) 12:	Change the target's armor class13:	Create a clone of the target 14:	Vision (see the character'ssurroundings) 15:	Teleport. Use the spell "reserved" field to specify thedestination. Use 0 for "back to the previous place", 1 for the topmost place inthe scenario, or any place id. 16:	Destroy cursed items 17:	Invisibility.Use the spell "reserved" field to specify the spell scope. Use 0 to indicate thatinvisible enemies should become visible, 1 to make the spell target invisible.All other codes are reserved. DO NOT USE THEM _no matter what_. ObjectsObjects can be single (like a sword) or multiple (like arrows, which are boughtby the dozen). When an item is multiple, the number of singular entities whichcompose it are written inside the "Nr. charges" field of the object template.Weight and other thingsTo define an object for use inside Dream, you must provide:-	An icon (which will be shown in the player information sheet and/or insideshops).-	A price. If the item is put in a shop, the shopkeeper will ask for the priceyou list. If the item is sold by the player, the character will get nine tenths(that is, 90%) of the listed price.-	A weight. Remember that the character won't be able to carry too muchweight. You might have a bit of fun creating very useful items which are soweighty that carrying them around is a problem.-	A public name. This is the name by which the player will know the object ifhe finds it. It should be quite vague (like, "a glass sphere").-	A private name. This is the name which is revealed through use of theIdentify spell. It should be very specific (like, "Crystal ball of scrying").Items bought in shops are known to the player by their private names: it issupposed that the seller told the characters all about the item.-	A list of body parts where the item can be stored. For example, a helmshould be allowed in the sack, in hand and above the head. Be sure to allow forthe sack at all times, or the characters will be unable to get it (all items endup in the sack when grabbed). As a general rule, allow everything to be kept inhand (otherwise it will be impossible to cast an Identify spell).-	A list of character classes which will be allowed to use (don) the item. Becreative, but remember the general rules in the following paragraph:Character classes and items-	Wizards shouldn't be allowed to use armor. Their armor class should be keptvery low, or they would quickly become the most powerful class. Similarly, allowthem to use only the least damaging weapons. All magic items, other than magicweapons and armor,  should be available to them.-	Clerics should be allowed to use all but the most powerful kinds of armourand weapons. They should be limited in the magic items they get access to.-	Fighters should be able to use every kind of armor and weaponry, both magicand mundane. No magic item should be allowed to them, with the only exception ofmagic weaponry and armor.-	Paladins and rangers should follow the same ground rules set for fighters,but rangers should be unable to use the best armor and able to use some magicitems. Paladins should be unable to keep precious and luxury items, likejewellery, which wouldn't befit their lifestyle.-	Rogues should be able to use almost all weaponry, but be very, very limitedas to armor (they need to be nimble and agile, and one simply can't run aroundinside a full plate mail). Rogues ought to be the only character class allowed touse throwing weapons.-	Don't inflate magic. A magic item should be a revered prize, not the rule.(there is only one magic item in "Spirit of Darkness", after all). If playerscomplain they don't get enough magic items, that'll whet their appetite for moreadventure.-	Don't allow players to become invincible. You can easily create a magic ringwhich will give them all an armor class of -10. So what? What are we going tothrow at them after that, dragons by the dozen? A character should find extremelyhard to reach armor classes below 0. A fifth level paladin should be very happyto own a single shield +1 and a long sword +1. Armor class -5 should be a revereddream until experience level 10 or so.Item categoriesItems can also be put in any of the following categories:-	Magic: a magic item is entitled to better protection against crushing blows.-	Weapon: a weapon is an item which can be wielded and used against monsters.See below for more information specific to weapons. If you state that an item isa weapon, be certain to provide the amount of damage the weapon inflicts onenemies. If an item is both magic and weapon, insert a positive value in the"base damage" box. For a long sword to do damage in the 1-8 range, select basedamage 0, number of dice 1, dice size 8. Then you might create a +1 magic longsword: type the same characteristics and put 1 in the base damage box. The magicsword will do damage in the 2-9 range.-	Armor: armor is an object that will protect the owner from being hit. Seebelow.-	Throwing weapon: a throwing weapon, like a bow, will propel ammunition, likean arrow. See below.-	Ammunition: ammunition is used in conjunction with a throwing weapon. Seebelow.-	Gives light: torches, lamps and lanterns are light-bringing devices, but youmight also create a magic beaming item. To create a standard luminous object, putit into the "gives light" category, then type the number of minutes it will workbefore discharging in the "Number of charges" box. To create a magicallyresplendent item, put it into the "gives light" and "magic" categories, and writea zero in the "Number of charges" box.-	Rechargeable: a torch can't be recharged, but a lantern might.-	Cursed: a cursed item can't be thrown away or sold by the owner oncewielded. In Dream 1.0 there's no way a character can get rid of a cursed item, souse this feature with wisdom.-	Intelligent: not yet implemented-	Food: if it's in the food category, then it is nourishing. Dream looks foritems of this kind every 24 hours, and removes one charge.-	Scroll: a scroll is a magic parchment inscribed with all the explanationsneeded for a spellcaster to recreate a spell. If a spellcaster owns a scroll, heor she may copy it inside his or her spellbook (then the scroll vanishes). So, ascroll is a most precious item for the player: keep them very rare.-	Book: a book is an item with an associated TEXT piece. When the player"uses" a book, the Dream engine shows the text inside the text windoid.-	Map: a map is an item with an associated PICT piece. When the player "uses"a map, the Dream engine shows the picture inside the PICT windoid.<H3>Armor</H3><P>An armor is a special item which protects the wearer. You can create both armorof the mundane type (say, a full plate mail) or magic (such as, a magicprotection ring).<P>The most important attribute of an armor is the bonus it gives to the character'sarmor class. In "Spirit of Darkness", rogues can buy leather armor, which isdescribed as an armor with bonus 2. This means that wearing leather armor the ACof the character will drop by two making them harder to hit. So, a rogue withstandard armor class (10) will be given armor class (8) when donning the leatherarmor.<H3>Weapons</H3><P>Weapons, like armor, are a special kind of object.<P>You, the scenario designer, can create any kind of weaponry you like: swords andmaces, bows and lances, magic items. Under Dream, it would even be possible tocreate a machinegun (but please don't: it would spoil most of the fantasy). InDream, weapons can either be for melee combat or for firing missiles.<P>As of version 1.0, you are limited in that you can't create a magic throwingweapon, like a magic bow. Still, you can create magic ammunition, like a magicarrow.<P>Throwing weapons may be self-propelled (e.g. darts) or need a throwing instrument(e.g. arrows, which need a bow). We are going to call the throwing weapons thatneed a throwing instrument "ammunition" (genial, huh?).<hr> <P><small><AHREF="index.html">Return to Table of Contents</A></small> <P><small><b>&copy;1998Luca Accomazzi <BR>HTML code &copy;1998 James Dessart</b></small> </BODY></HTML>
