<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN"><HTML><HEAD> <TITLE>Scenario Maker</TITLE> </HEAD><BODY><H1>Legalese considerations</H1><P>Apple, Macintosh, Radius, Pivot, Addison Wesley, and almost all uppercase termsused in this manual tend to be trademarks or registered trademarks of theirrespective owners. Those owners tend to be huge, wealthy companies whose staffinclude blood-thirsty lawyers by the dozen. The lawyers are usually kept insidesmall rooms, and fed only once a day with stale bread and water; then they arethrown at those guys who use the copyrighted, trademarked and Jeeze-knows-whatterms without including a note such as this, and strange symbols (like &copy;,&reg; and <small><small>TM</small></small>).<P>I do hope I satisfied the legal requirement of the above-mentioned firms. If Ididn't, a short, sharp whistle thrown in my direction would be more than enoughto make me comply. <hr><P><small><A HREF="index.html">Return to Table of Contents</A></small><P><small><b>&copy;1998 Luca Accomazzi<BR>HTML code &copy;1998 James Dessart</b></small> </BODY></HTML>
