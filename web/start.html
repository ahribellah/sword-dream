I'll put here the map for"Spirit of Darkness", so that you may better understand what a scenario map is.<P><center><img src="examplemap.gif" align=center></center><P>Each of the boxes in the graph above is known as a "place". The arrows connectplaces: if there is an arrow between two places, then the place above contains anentrance to the place below. Exiting from the place below always takes thecharacters to the place above, from whence they came.<P>The depth of the map is not an issue. You can create a twenty level dungeon, ifyou like, or a skyscraper with sixty floors. You can also reuse some of thecomponents. You might, for example, have two towns in the valley, and put thesame shop in both. Players entering the shop from town 1 will always exit to town1, and players entering from town 2 will find themselves back to town 2 when theyexit the shop. To them, there will be two identical shops in the two differenttowns.<P><b>Warning:</b> The one rule that can't be broken when designing a scenario map is: aplace is contained in a place; when exiting a place the characters will return tothe place from where they came.<P>There are also a couple of conventions to be remembered: <P>First, when the characters exit from the topmost place, they are exiting thescenario. Dream will ask the player if he/she wishes to continue playing anotherscenario or exit the game session.<P>Second, the topmost place must have a numeric identifier of 1000. Dream will putthe player characters inside the place with ID 1000, whenever the player starts anew scenario.<hr><P><small><A HREF="index.html">Return to Table of Contents</A></small><P><small><b>&copy;1998 Luca Accomazzi<BR>HTML code &copy;1998 James Dessart</b></small></BODY></HTML>
