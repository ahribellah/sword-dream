Every entity is contained inside a Macintoshresource. The resource is characterised by a type (four characters; e.g. 'Shop'for a shop, 'Mstr' for a monster) and a numeric identifier (e.g. the one 'Mstr'whose numeric ID is 1000 might be a kobold).<P>Take a look: drag a Dream scenario upon the ResEdit application icon. You mightuse 'Spirit of Darkness', one sample adventure which is included with the Dreamapplication itself.<P>You'll see, inside a window, the various resources which comprise a scenario.They include:<UL><LI>'Aren': an arena (that is, a room where fighting takes place)<LI>'icl8', 'icl4' and 'ICN#': icons for monsters, objects and game locations<LI>'Info': Information and instructions about the scenario, created by the game	designer (you) for the Dream gaming system<LI>'MDeL': a monster decision list, that is, a list of orders for a monster to	follow<LI>'Mstr': a monster type<LI>'Nctr': Encounter<LI>'Obj ': an item (either sold at a shop or found inside a monster's lair)<LI>'PICT': a picture showing a place in full detail <LI>	'Plac': a place to	visit (that is, a map as show in the Dream main window)<LI>'Ridl': a question to be asked to the player, a list of possible answers and	the consequences of each answer (for short 'a riddle')<LI>'Shop': List of items for sale inside a shop<LI>'SMkr': Information on the scenario created by the ScenarioMaker application	for its own purposes<LI>'snd ': Digitised sound, used to make the monsters roar or speak<LI>'Spel': a spell (either a wizard's or a cleric's)<LI>'STR#': Collection of tips which the adventurers will be given inside inns.<LI>'TEXT', 'styl': description of the places. To be shown in the description	windoid and spoken aloud by Dream<LI>'Trap': a mechanical or magical device<LI>'vers': Scenario version<LI>'Wndr': Wandering monsters list</UL><P>Not all scenarios will include every kind of resource listed above. Complexscenarios might include other kinds of resources to obtain a sophisticated effectknown as 'overriding', which is discussed later in this manual.<P>Most resources listed above can be created by filling in a simple template (thatis, a dialog box with fields). For example, let's try to see what makes a monstertick. Using ResEdit, open the file 'ScenarioMaker.rez', which you found in thesame package which included this manual and the ScenarioMaker application. Now,double-click on the 'Mstr' icon inside the 'Spirit of Darkness' window. You'llsee a list of monsters. Choose one, and open it with another double-click. Awindow will open showing the description for this monster. You won't understandmuch, for now: this manual will enable you to understand how the template you'relooking at turns into a dangerous foe for player characters.<hr> <P><small><A HREF="index.html">Return to Table of Contents</A></small><P><small><b>&copy;1998 Luca Accomazzi <BR>HTML code &copy;1998 JamesDessart</b></small> </BODY></HTML>
